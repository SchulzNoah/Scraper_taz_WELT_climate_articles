## Scraping and analysing taz + WELT climate change articles
This repository contains two Python scripts that scrape and analyze the content and titles of taz and WELT newspaper articles on the topic of climate change. Please note that the code was written in 2024 and therefore the scrapers may no longer work (change in the structure of the pages).
